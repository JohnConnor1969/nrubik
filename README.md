# nrubik
An N-Curses Rubik's Cube Emulator

NRubik was made due to the severe lack of n-curses Rubik's cube emulators. This very possibly might be the first one. 

# What does it look like?

Something like this:

Here is it solved (Yes, it's possible):

# How do I install it?

Simply download the single, small "nrubik" python script and run it with a curses supported python2 or python3 interpreter. (Yes, the script works with both python2 and python3 :)

# No. How do I _install_ it?

What, you mean with a package manager? See here later for updates.

# Why is orange magenta?

On 8 color terminals, there is no orange but there is magenta. If you're confused why it's labeled orange in the first place, on an ordinary Rubik's Cube that is where orange would be.

# There are so many features missing. Why?

I purposely left out some features so that any terminal geek can try out this rubik's cube simulator without having to learn how to rotate the cube or turn counter clockwise or do half turns. Don't get me wrong, this is a complete Rubik's Cube simulation, but avid Rubik's Cube solvers might be frustrated that this Rubik's Cube cannot be as easily turned and twisted. Another advantage of simplifying the interface, however, is that avid Rubik's Cube solvers now have a new challenge, and are forced to think of the Rubik's Cube in a different way. If I see that there are people who want a more complex N-Curses rubik's cube simulator, then I will create it under the name of "nrubik-pro," or something similar.
